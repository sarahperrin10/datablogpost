Artist Chris Jordan uses thousands of photographs of everyday objects, often various kinds of garbage, to create a larger image with the purpose of making the viewer conceptualize the consequences of mass consumption. In this work, entitled “Venus, 2011,” Jordan uses 240,000 plastic bags to recreate Sandro Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus.” The number of bags in this image is the estimated number of plastic bags consumed globally every ten seconds. This image is part of a larger series called “Running the Numbers II: Portraits of Global Mass Culture.” According to Jordan, sociologists believe we cannot grasp numbers past a few thousand. And yet here he tries to defy that “rule” by putting a mass phenomenon like plastic use in both a beautiful and horrifying visualization. Jordan’s use of plastic bags almost corrupts this well-known image of Venus, in the same way that plastic is corrupting and obfuscating our Earth.

In David McCandless’ piece “Gender Pay Gap US, UK” the difference in salary between women and men in various jobs is plotted out. The line connecting the female salary and the male salary represents the “gap” so often talked about. I appreciate how this buzzword and sound bite is rendered visual in the space between point A and point B. The user can also change the way the gap is visualized. For instance, the default setting is based off of yearly salary in thousands, but can be plotted out based off the percent difference of the gap instead. Like the battle that is constantly fought over this issue, this work is also not a static representation of the pay gap. Instead, the visualization regenerates based on the latest statistics from their sources.
